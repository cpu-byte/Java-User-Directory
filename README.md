# Java User Directory
Java domain implementation of a user directory with teams.

## Notes
- This repository contains the code domain.
- There is no implementation for data storage, and no interface (`CL` nor `GUI`).
- The project has included `JUnit Testing` files which have `100%` class-method-line coverage.
- Java documentation for this project is auto-generated by IntelliJ and [viewable online](https://dropcmd.github.io/Java-User-Directory/).
- Main issues are discussed in the Further Development section.
- The class diagram for this project can be seen below.

## Running
1. Load the Java project into IDE of choice with `Java JDK` version `15` or higher* and `JUnit` version `5` or higher.
2. Run the `Main` class `main()` method in `/src/` folder for a basic domain demonstration.
3. Run the `/src/testing/` folder for `JUnit Testing`.
4. Running step 3 with coverage should yield `100%` class-method-line coverage.

*while the solution could be developed in older `JDK` versions, some aspects used in this implementation use newer `JDK` features, e.g. local variable type inference.

## Further Development

These are the current drawbacks to my project. The tasked project has a scope to implement a section of a much larger system as a part of a `Applied Software Engineering` assignment. I've implemented key features with required methodologies detailed in the assignment specification. Given more time, I would attempt to resolve the issues.

The many-to-many connection affecting the team-employee relationship is a significant issue. To add a user to a team, both a user and a team need to change their field's values, creating redundancy. I tried to resolve part of the problem by search teams and users directories when an item is removed to eliminate stagnate data. While my solution works for a part of the problem, it is a crooked approach with drawbacks. Tackling the many-to-many relationship with a TeamUser class that holds each team-user relationship would solve the issue. Additional metadata could be added to the class like is the relationship active, when was the connection first initialised, etc. The diagram below is the class depiction of the proposed improvement.

The Employee and Manager classes have UserInterface which they implement (Employee is a superclass of Manager, Employee implements UserInterface). While this structure is valid, it is not optimal as the Manager class doesn't add any more functionality. Any exclusive functionality is integrated into other parts of the application, e.g. checking the author of a updateUserBio(). Instead of checking the object type of author, check for a class field named "role" that could contain EMPLOYEE, MANAGER, etc. Example of this relationship is detailed below.
